#Programming 1 - Assignment 5
#Your name(s):


# The file Toyota5.csv includes data for 1000 used Toyota Corollas, 
# including their prices and specification information:

#Price (in dollars)
#Age (in months)
#Mileage 
#Horse_Power
#Metallic_Color (1=yes, 0=no)
#Automatic (1=yes, 0=no)
#CC (cylinder volume)
#Doors
#Weight (in kg)
#Fuel Type (diesel, petrol, CNG)


# Load "Toyota5.csv" and save it as carsData.
# Load any packages that you may use for this assignment




#Q1:
# Check all the columns/variable to find the variable that has missing values. 
# Locate and replace missing values with the average
# of the non-missing values of the corresponding variable.




#Q2:
# Summarize the fuel type variable using either a frequency table or a plot.
# Write a code that returns the name of the most common fuel type category.




#Q3:
# Create a boxplot that compares the distribution of price across different fuel types.
# Also, write a code that calculates the average price for each of these fuel type categories.
# Which fuel category has the highest average price? 
# (write a code that returns both the name and the average price of this category)




#Q4:
# Create two scatterplots: Price (y-axis) vs. Age (x-axis), Price (y-axis) vs. Mileage (x-axis)
# Which of the variables is more correlated with price? 
# Calculate the appropriate measure that can help you answer this question




#Q5:
# Referring to the plots of Q4, identify and remove the three cars that are outliers with higher price.
# Save the results as a new dataset, called carsUpdated.




#Q6: 
# Run a regression of price using age as the only predictor. (use the updated dataset)
# Save the results as regAge. Write a code that returns the summary of the results.




#Q7: 
# Run a regression of price using mileage as the main predictor. (use the updated dataset)
# Save the results as regMileage. Write a code that returns the summary of the results.




#Q8:
# Create a table that compares the two regression models in terms of residual standard error and r-squares. 
# (Note: you can do so by building a dataframe of the desired outputs or using stargazer function. 
# In either case, make sure reach row/column is labeled accordingly.)
